I am a dedicated researcher and academician with expertise in **Cyber Security, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Computer Vision, and Medical Image Processing**. Recently, I have developed a keen interest in **Quantum Computing**, a transformative paradigm, as well as in **Large Language Models (LLMs), AI Security and Privacy, and Trustworthy AI**‚Äîareas that are increasingly crucial in building robust, ethical, and responsible intelligent systems. My work aims to advance technologies that enhance human life, bolster security, and improve system efficiency. I am passionate about applying deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems in NLP, image processing, bioinformatics, and beyond.
